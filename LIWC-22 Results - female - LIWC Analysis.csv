6253,2125,"i (17f) don't exactly know which community i should let this out, although i've decided to let it out here since depression is the most likely condition i am experiencing. i just hope at least one person could take time into reading this, a i feel hopeless. i am in the dilemma of choosing whether i should end it all, or keep myself alive with the feeling of a heavily burdening conscience so i wouldn't make thing harder and almost impossible for my mom and dad if my death will cost not only a loss in their life or grief, but also an amplified struggle in the problem they already have been having so much of their time spent on, specifically financial problems. my mom is very eager to work hard so that i could finish my study and graduate college so that i could also make a living and that they would no longer have to be in debt of taking care of me. however, i do not feel like i have any more strength to go on, lest i may not even be able to ever reach graduation, and it had never been of my greatest interest.i have already been decided at the very age of 10 that i would take my life. but i wa a child, i couldn't have known how to do so, or even have the material to take it. i must also mention my parent were immigrant worker in the middle east, specifically in saudi arabia. i wa raised and born there until my mom and i were able to fly back to our home country, the philippines, when i wa around 12 year old. i gave out this information to let you know that my whole childhood, i spent my whole life in a room (though i wa still able to go with my mom and dad when there were special occassions and necessity to be bought) since going out on my own wa not safe in that country and i'd only had one childhood playmate and online friend (although i did manage to make some friend from school during my freshman year), having each day to go to school and wait for my parent to come home, although they were more often than not, exhausted when they did. in short, i've had very little social development from my childhood which made it very difficult when i'd experience of adapting to social environment from the time i'd move to my home country at the age of 12 and so on.i am now 17. never have i ever been able to afford service such a therapy, or a diagnosis to get started on my potentially existing but unknown psychological condition i may have, making it harder for me to adapt to my environment. i have long suspected myself of being part of the autism spectrum, however i won't focus on it and rather continue with the struggle i've had my entire life.i wa never able to see myself fit naturally in this world, specifically the way i've thought about social relationship and how it relates to myself. i have had often pondered on question ruminating regarding my identity and who i am a a person. i have adapted to the idea that there truly is no definite ""me"" if i am a human that is constantly evolving and growing. however, sometimes i get concerned myself how i don't see myself a person, or even a human at all. i am not able to perceive myself, i don't see a person in me. this feel like a complicated topic which could be stemmed from many possible aspect of my life, however, i feel like it also ha to do with my great interest in art. i am able to write poetry, write songs, practice music, and even do paintings. this give me a sense of purpose. however, without my action of investing into art, i feel like i am nothing. it is the only thing i'm good at, but the majority of the theme in my creations, is the feeling of being soulless and empty. it is a recurring theme for all of my creations, though i do not know how i have managed to create so much. i wrote poem since i wa 9 to create a brief imagery of my inner world, though some have reached a thousand words. i wrote song since i wa 13 to let my poem have a melody in which i could sing along to again and again for myself so that the recurring thought and feeling i have had could be easier to sit with since i like music and it ha helped me coped for so long. i practice and learn music so that i could put my body into motion and have rhythm so that i could feel like it's not too suffocating when it's quiet and i'm all alone. i've drawn painting not for the purpose of aesthetic and to create material for entertainment, but rather to let myself have a materialized visualisation or imagery of my emotion and inner world, a they are harder to depict in just text language or speech sometimes.i've wanted to go to heaven and have vividly dreamt of flying to heaven since i wa 6. something about the idea of heaven, away from this world, becoming an angel so that i could still exist, but not involved in the physical world wa a fantasy i've always entertained myself with. even my imaginary friend were angel and i would talk to them by looking up at the ceiling a i imagine that they are flying up there. sometimes i even think and entertain myself by asking my imaginary friend of when i'll ever be able to join them soon enough at the time.besides all of that, i feel very exhausted and drained of being human. i don't feel like i ought to exist if i no longer have strength, a i would no longer be able to serve any purpose nor action into this world. sometimes i feel a though my mind and soul have advanced fairly fast, i feel like a if i am dying from old age, but my body wa still young. i wa able to live for this long a everytime, mom wa the only reason i did so. even on day where i felt like she could never have understood me, she still showed up for me. the only reason why i ever stayed in this life wa so that i could wake up to the effort of mom preparing breakfast for me to eat and get ready for the day. i didn't want to let mom feel a though her effort are not for nothing, so i wanted to try and give myself another chance to live since i wa 10, the age of when i decided i should end it all. dad ha been often long gone and absent for a long a i remember.sometimes, i ponder and ask, ""mom, are you happy even if you've already been living long enough?""she always say ""yes.""sometimes with a bit of a pause and an extended answer.""that's why mama is always working hard for bunso (a traditional name for the youngest child in the family) to be able to finish her study so she could live and take care of us,"" is what she would always say.so what if i so happen to be gone sooner than expected?now, i admit that a lot of change have happened in my life, even some improvements, and i agree that i've learned a lot enough to be able to say i'm a completely different person now, but some thing do not change. i had an unusual dreadful feeling i might die last year. the past years, i've had chest pain mixed with uncontrollable tear and an unexplainable urge of wanting to scream out how i no longer do not want to deal with this pain, but when i do scream, it's like a cry of an infant. loud and incoherent. i thought they were anxiety attack when i wa younger, but i slowly realise it's from emotional distress. usually, it's once a year. i thought it wouldn't happen again when it first happened to me since it felt physically impossible to deal with. during these attacks, i will experience a breakdown accompanied by a strong feeling of wanting to mentally shut down, it's like my brain is asking to be cut off, but the rest of my physical body is still alive, breathing, my whole system is in conflict. even if my eyes, head, and chest would already be in so much pain, the human body still ha the instinct to breathe, it can't give up. this year feel more critical. i have experienced it thrice this year. right now, a i am typing, i have had pause where i cry out and still feel the chest pain lingering. sometimes it feel like a heart attack. sometimes it feel like i could die in any moment. sometimes i feel like i could die in my sleep. these days, i have not been able to have any appetite and am able to go on for more than 18 hour without even realizing my hunger, until mom sometimes stop by to remind me to eat. it is currently the afternoon, i've only had a bottle of milk beverage of caffeine flavour, no breakfast. mom had reminded me to eat, but i've decided to turn it down for later since she came in a i wa typing. i feel like... i don't enough time left in this world. i am very tired of being human. i am very tired of learning how to be human. i am very tired of learning how to act human. i am tired of having to be seem normal so i would not be a social reject, so that i can land the chance of having livelihood. i am very tired of having voice of imagined people constantly monitoring my every thought and movement, critizing every part of it. i am very tired of my mind and intellectual capability to not being able to catch up in this world. i am very tired of thinking i am not good enough. i am very tired of thinking how i should morph myself, constantly comparing myself with every person i come across just so i could be human. i am very tired with the issue i have catching up with my physical appearance. i am very tired of this body. i am very tired of thinking i am not trying hard enough, but reflecting on myself, i have tried too hard for long enough that i have exhausted this body.i dream so vividly when i'm asleep. i have had trouble waking up properly the past few month a it feel like my state in my dream world is real, there had been multiple episode this year, more than i could remember, about more than several circumstance where i would be asleep and it feel too quiet, but i suddenly wake up gasping for air, screaming, and crying, like a if i wasn't breathing in my sleep. but my body doesn't give up. although i don't know if it can keep up any longer.there are a few more month before i could turn 18 next year, with my birthday being on the 14th of may. but the year is soon ending. i am currently cry with the extremely painful chest pain and heartache that is accompanied by it. hopefully, before this year ends, i can compile the song i have recorded for the past year up for release. so that before the year ends, something of me may remain in this world a i let it leave to the chance of me dying in my sleep or not. i don't want to imagine mom walking into my room seeing my lifeless body surrounded by weapon or of any other material that may cause death. i don't want her to think my death would ever be intentional. i don't want her to think it's her fault, but i am so sorry. i may have written a suicide letter draft earlier this year, but perhaps this could be the last one. it is not perfect, but i'll let it be. this is nobody's fault, i am just too tired. so that mom would never think it's intentional... if i ever die, please may it be a silent one in my sleep. i hope the heaven are listening if they ever do exist. i've learned a lot and am proud of myself for how much i have been able to live out for this long. however, i feel a though i have experienced enough of this human life. but perhaps my body would still live after next year. but from the time i have written this down, consider this a day of my death. perhaps this chance in life wa an unlucky gamble.for everything that ha happened, i am happy, but i want to end it all. passing away feel the best option right now, but i am in conflict a to what i should do a it hurt for me to imagine mom to be hurt when i am gone. i feel like a puppet since birth learning to be human in debt for the circle of life.",depression,1,12.82,11.54,0.09,0.13,0.49,0.53,4.91,5.17,14.46,11.49,8.66,7.69,2.3,,1.76

8058,1437,"hello, i am assuming a majority of you will not read this so basically i have a fear of dying because doctor technically dont know what is wrong with me and im constantly sick. please send word of encouragement.whole story:i am a 16 year old girl who ha recently developed health anxiety after having anxiety for 8 years. i developed health anxiety after experiencing some pretty bad chest pain and skipped heart beats. it felt like i wa dying and they would give me panic attacks. i would call my mom at 3am every single night and tell her that i wa dying and that i needed help. everyone told me that it wa just the anxiety and i had nothing to worry about. i ended up getting a heart monitor for a week and it confirmed that i wa having skipped heart beat and sometimes even triple skipped heart beats. it is apparently very normal and not a cause for concern. they said the only reason i could feel them wa because i had a rib that wa inflamed. i wa doing a lot better after that and i wasnt feeling anxious about my health. then i got a really bad infection in october and i almost went septic. after that infection i had bout of high heart rate and blood pressure. my heart rate would be resting at 130 when i wa sitting. i would constantly feel like i wa going to pas out. i wa sitting down in class and all of a sudden i felt my vision going out and i told my teacher i needed help. my classmate were super helpful and i felt really thankful for them. they cleared the chair out of the way and they helped me into a wheelchair when the nurse came. my mom took me to the hospital and my heart rate came down with iv fluid so they sent me home and said i wa probably dehydrated. four more hospital visit later with chest pain, presyncope, high rate rate and they still dont know what is going on. i ended up getting pink eye one day so my grandma took me to the hospital and i got prescribed med and i went home. i had a bowl of chili, a bowl of soup, and half a sandwich with my grandma. my grandma left and about 20 minute later i called 911 on myself. all of a sudden my head wa burning like my whole brain felt like it wa on fire and i wa losing consciousness. i dailed 911 and made sure my door wa unlocked. a local volunteer showed up and said my oxygen level were low. i wa hooked up to oxygen and profusely shaking by the time the ambulance arrived. my mom wa cry and obviously worried because i had been sick for a while now and im sure she thought i wa finally dying this time. i wa in the ambulance where i had a sustained heart rate of 140 which actually isnt bad compared to the heart rate i get now. the doctor sent me home after doing chest x-rays, treponin and d-dimer test, and multiple ecgs. i got a referral to a cardiologist and he told me it wa anxiety. they tried doing orthostatic blood pressure but i almost passed out while i wa laying down so they stopped and immediately called in people to take a manual heart rate and blood pressure. my heart rate wa 130 and my blood pressure wa 160/89. i would like to note that my blood pressure and heart rate are not consistently that high. i wa feeling better after getting some water and a cold wash cloth. they put another heart monitor on me after that happened. i wa sent down to do a urine test and while getting off the elevator i dropped to the ground and told my mom that i didnt feel well. the wonderful lady working in the lab immediately rushed over and lifted me into a room. they hugged me and my mom and told me that i would be okay. i cried. that wa the most comforting thing i couldve ever been told in that moment especially because i genuinely thought i wasnt going to be alive much longer. i felt so comforted and i dont think ill ever forget those two a long a i live. i wa sent home after doing lab and wa still experiencing episode of almost fainting. about a week later i ended up going to the hospital because my heart rate wa 130 while sitting in school resting and i felt sick. the doctor noticed that i had already been to the hospital many time and that i responded very well to iv fluids. he decided to wait an hour and see if my heart rate would go down and it didnt so i wa prescribed a beta blocker. three day after that i went back to the hospital because i felt like i wa going to be dead any minute. i wasnt drinking or eating very well and i had presyncope three time in a row. my mom drove me to the hospital and it turn out i had the flu and i wa allowed to stop taking the beta blocker(metoprolol suck butthole). they did agree that my heart rate and presyncope episode were highly concerning and made me a special referral to get an echocardiogram.  got my echocardiogram and everything wa normal and i had a talk with a different cardiologist after. she heard my symptom and immediately said that i have some form of dysautonomia. i wa doing pretty good for a couple day now that i knew how to manage symptoms. then i got vertigo from the flu. i currently still have vertigo and it is not fun. i am convinced that i will not wake up one morning. my heart rate today wa very high and wouldnt go down even after drinking lot of water. i am now super nervous that i have pneumonia because i cant stop coughing and i am constantly short of breath. i have been sick 7 time now since august and i am worried that my body wont
