2240,2240,"psa: this is very long but i (18m) have amazing parent and great friend so i dont want to come off a selfish because many have it so much worse, but nonetheless, this is how i feel.as corny a it sounds, my whole life i have struggled with severe depression and anxiety, but i keep it all private. the earliest example i can think of is when i wa 5, i used to spend hour cry each night scared my parent were gonna die and i couldnt sleep without them. fast forward to 9-10 year old, no more separation anxiety but i started to genuinely want to die however i didnt wanna feel the pain so nothing ever came out of it. fast forward to 12 years, i would have panic attack over everything but they eventually stopped. at 13 i sort of tried to kill myself by drowning in the bathtub but survival instinct kicked in i guess and i couldnt just not breathe. i saw a psychologist but i told them i wa fine just so i could leave. 14-17 were better, i wasnt struggling so hard with depression but still severe anxiety. early this year i wa convinced i had 6 type of cancer at once with minimal reasoning and the anxiety wa so debilitating i had to miss work and school for a couple of weeks. i saw 8 different doctor and had several test done but it took me a long time to realize i wa actually healthy. this brought me to a therapist who didnt really help, so i quit seeing her after about 5 visits. those month were easily the worst month of my life. i wa doing better for a little while until about 3 month ago. my dog that ive had since i wa 5 passed away. one of my best friend for 9 year leaf our friend group after suddenly hating us. i impulsively tried to kill myself again on my way home from work in october by swerving off the interstate into a tree. obviously i didnt die, but i did break my foot in 8 spot and sprained my other ankle and i should be able to walk in february. i never told my parent this wa intentional, i just had said i wa ran off the road and the other car didnt stop. the only thing really stopping me now from doing it is that im afraid of what happens after. i wa raised strictly christian but ive never been able to believe in it no matter how hard i tried, nothing against the religion tho. if i could just be asleep eternally, i would do that in a heartbeat but obviously thats impossible. i think my main issue is that i dont find much joy in anything, but the bad part remain, so why would i want to live through all the negative with minor positive that cant outweigh them? i still dread the day my parent die, theyre pushing 50 and im horrified one day theyll randomly get cancer. im scared to grow up, i wish i could relive the past 3 years. i moved 30 min away from my hometown sophomore year and i have yet to make any friend here, so i hate going to school. my friend group and i were much closer in the last couple of year (we still are close though). academically, i have had all a and b throughout high school, but this semester is very rough, i have 2 f and practically zero motivation to bring them up. romantically, im in love, truly, with this one girl who is a mutual friend but too afraid to get to know her more a ive never tried to pursue love before, and im anxious im gonna miss out on my only chance of a future partner. im moving out soon for college with 3 of my friend and i am excited for that but i also hate the idea that im growing up. i put up a good show to my parent so they truly think im happy. we were poor growing up (were financially stable now though), my father is an immigrant and my mother ha had debilitating back pain since her first pregnancy, so my childhood wasnt necessarily the most fun, but i wa always loved. seeing my parent cry that im growing up make me horribly depressed a well. im afraid to leave this life behind when i move, leave my parent and other dog, but my heart really want to get away for a while. i am very emotionally dependent on my friend too, especially when theyre asleep at night and im wide awake and cant talk to them, i just get uncontrollably anxious. ive just been rambling on but i just dont know what to do. i tried exercise my therapist recommended but none helped, she diagnosed me with generalized depression and anxiety but never prescribed anything. i just want these feeling to end and it seems death (or an eternal sleep) are the only answer. i am not in danger of committing tho so do not worry, im too afraid of what happens after death to try again. none of my family or friend know this about me but i dont want to tell them because i dont want them to feel a if they are in any way responsible for it. ive held this in and dealt with it so long and im exhausted. i dont know what to do.",suicide,1,15.07,12.59,0.43,0,0.43,1.4,4.41,3.98,13.13,10.23,8.83,9.26,3.12,,-3.81

i might a well prepare for a life in the fast food industry. i don't even have many technical skill either. i'm just not very good at anything.i'm gaining weight, i'm in the obese weight category, even if i don't look fat when i have clothes on. i know it's only going to get worse.this might be more personal, but it's very relevant to the way i'm feeling right now. i've always had a very strong desire to be female, ever since i wa a child, even if i didn't realize it at the time. i find being a man to be intensely repulsive. that's a lot more to it but i'd rather not bore you with the details. i'm taking female hormones, at the moment, and it's a low dose (4mg estradiol, 100mg spironolactone). the result is being stuck in some kind of limbo state where i'm a 20 year old man with a swollen chest that show in t-shirt but can't ever be considered actual breasts. nothing else ha been happening. i still look like a man, and it feel like i haven't been making any progress despite taking t suppressor for almost 2 year and estrogen for almost a full year. i wa hoping to get that 4mg dose increased to 6mg in my next visit, but i know for sure that isn't happening now because i still haven't gotten bloodwork done and it's only a week before the visit, and i haven't been taking my other medication at all either. no way my dose is being increased now. i'm not sure how much more of this i can take. 4mg estradiol i thought would be enough to at least to do something but apparently having a permanently barely developed chest is it. my parent and i get into fight over this stuff all the time. everything just feel so hopeless.and bloodwork is something i dread. how child are with needle is how i am with bloodwork. i don't know what it is, but i'm real bad with it. and when i say bad, i mean one time i passed out before the first vial wa even filled.i can't even socialize with other people. it's so hard for me to just to talk to anyone and i don't know why. i have no friends, i have no social life at all. it get so lonely.yesterday i thought about killing myself. even today i'm still considering suicide. i've always had day throughout my life where i seriously thought i needed to kill myself. they usually pass, and this will too, probably. but it's so hard to look at everything i've done in these past 2 year and see it a anything other than a massive failure. i can't even look at myself in the mirror without being disgusted. sometimes i just want it all to stop.i really tried these past few month to get my life back in order. i wa going back to school, going to driving lesson to get my license. and for a while, i wa feeling really good. after getting my driver's license and doing fairly well in my classes, i wa really feeling like i wa finally getting everything together. i wa feeling like i wa actually becoming an adult, finally. but after another spat with my parent about not taking one of my medications, after realizing i wasn't going to get my bloodwork done 2 week before the appointment, and after realizing i wa going to get a d in one of my classes, i just fell back into depression. at least i haven't had any strong intrusive thought about committing murder in months. that's about the only positive i can find about all this.a really pathetic life honestly, and it's all my fault.",depression,1,11.7,10.92,0,0.26,0,0.35,5.24,5.33,13.28,11.53,9.61,6.64,3.41,,0.48

into a very mentally ill individual. i started to develop severe chronic upper back pain and fatigue around 19 a well and haven't been able to find out the cause besides perhaps stress, muscle imbalances, and my spine being curved out of position.i accumulated a lot of debt in my early adulthood from dropping out of college, credit cards, and a bad car loan which i became delinquent on. i paid it all off, developed a healthy diet and exercise regime for years, went to doctor and none of it helped. i just got more stressed and exhausted and eventually got overwhelmed and accumulated the same amount of debt, got out of shape again, and my mental health is worse than ever.i really need to find some sort of assistance but i don't know how. it feel like i'm stuck in this situation of not being able to get better until i have money, and not having money until i can get better.i need some advice or someone to refer me to some resources. i've tried doing this in the past a few time and i

fatigue not caused by this a they existed whilst i wa at a healthy weight and had a good diet and exercise regime)*i can't physically tolerate working a full-time job, my last job wa overnights at a hotel and even after doing that easy job i could do nothing but collapse after work and couldn't even play game or watch something*i walked/biked a total of 6 mile per day to my last job for 2 year and my conditioning never improved nor did my physical pain, worsened if anything. i walked about half a mile yesterday and it left my rib in pain for hour after i got home and i collapsed.mental:*frozen in place can't do anything (choice paralysis)*extremely depressed, emotionally numb almost all the time, feel barely any joy, think about wanting to die every day*can't organize my thought or formulate or stick to plan (executive function) i've been diagnosed with adhd inattentive in the past but it may be autism not sure. adderall xr really messed me up although it helped for about 9 months.*i believe i've developed agoraphobia or/and avoidant personality disorder or perhaps both but haven't been diagnosed a i haven't been able to afford a doctor in about 4 year and rarely could before that*sense of dread/fear for the future encompasses my being at all times*have absolutely no self-control, i can't make myself do literally anything it's like i live purely on autopilot and can't take the controls*terrified of being around people to the extent that i just avoid leaving my room, it's not a conscious decision i'm just frozen here*too anxious to check bank account or look for job or try and get help or anything (even writing this post make me extremely anxious and i'm having a panic attack writing it)*extremely hypervigilant of my surroundings, particularly noise and i get very stressed and tense just from hearing people talk or dog barking or thing like that*can't groom myself properly, i smell bad, barely brush my teeth anymore,

to my family, never really had a single person i could trust*i've never had sex or had a girlfriend mostly due to my anxiety, partially due to my poor financial and living situation that's made it difficult*i've been talking to a girl online for a few month and she brought up maybe visiting me next year but i don't know where i'll be living and i probably won't have the money to give her a good

6439,2311,"throwaway account, my family follow me on my main.28m. i've spent the entirety of my life trying to run away from my mental health. a far back a i can remember i have had passive suicidal ideations. whenever thing would get bad for me, i'd think about how i could just check myself out and be through with it all. it's not a healthy coping mechanism but at this point i've been doing it so long that i can't stop myself. i feel so constantly stressed that even the slightest issue will do me in. if i drop a plate, or if i have to make a phone call, i'm ruined for the day. i worry constantly about lock on doors. i lock my car at least 8 time every time i get out of it, and i have to check the door is locked at least a dozen time before i'm willing to leave, even then i'm convinced i left it open and people are going to break in and steal all the worthless tchotchke i have acquired. that's just on a personal level. i can't look at the news, i can't think about the future. i know the world is gonna burn up, and i know corporation are raping our planet, but i can't do a damn thing about it and that ha me constantly feeling helpless. there's more, but i'm sure you get the absolute gist.my family is aware kind of that i'm not well mentally, but i don't think they know the extent to which i'm struggling. i've had to hide it from them since we have intergenerational trauma from multiple member of the family having various mental illness that have been dealt with with varying level of success.my uncle killed himself before i wa born, and my mom ha never moved on. my grandfather killed himself, and my dad wa the one who found him. he never dealt with his trauma either. my mom independent (or because) of that ha had a lifetime of issues, her ball of yarn is much more tangled and larger than mine, so to speak. my dad play everything much closer to the vest, he'll never admit to u when anything is bothering him and i have no idea how he manages. mom meanwhile escape with drinking, although in recent year she's much more into weed. it's unfortunate she won't get real help but she's better smoking than she wa a a drinker, when she wa much more prone to being angry a a drunk.my sister is the gold star of the family, and i mean that genuinely. she's had her own issue with our family, but go to therapy regularly and manages to keep herself in a good head space. i wish i were half a competent an adult a she is. she's been holding down a career a a therapist and i'm damn proud of her, seems like every time i talk to her she ha been promoted, or completed a personal goal of some kind, or is otherwise genuinely contented.that brings u to me. i remember realizing that it wasn't normal to wish i wa dead for the smallest of inconveniences, and finally mustered up the courage at the age of 12 or so to tell my mom i thought i needed help. i sat down with her, and explained that i had been feeling darkly depressed, not just regular sad, and had been for quite some time. my mom laughed at me. she said ""aw, you're fine."" and that wa that. the next day, i remember vividly, she wa drinking with a few of her friend in our backyard. i wa walking past, and she wa telling them about how i told her \*in confidence\* that i thought i wa depressed, and she wa telling it a a joke. i realized at that moment not only could i not turn to her with my mental concerns, i couldn't trust her to not gossip about my concern to others.i tried to talk to my dad, but i never found the right words. part of me wa concerned he'd laugh at me also, but i also just remember not wanting to stress him out. i got really used to just dealing with constantly feeling like a depressed anxious stressed out ball of shit.maybe unfortunately in retrospect, i got really good at it. for whatever reason, i've always been an excellent student, and i played sport all through my time in school. i had friends, and i went on a few dates. i came to realize how fucked up my other family member are, since my mom would regularly ask me to make sure i'm not planning on killing myself. sure you might read that and think ""well why not admit to her?"" but you gotta know my mom, she isn't asking because she want to help, she is asking because she want the satisfaction of knowing the answer is no. both side of the family have had significant issue over these year a well, so there wa always something bigger that needed family attention.i continued this routine for years, and only hit a few roadblocks. after high school suddenly all my friend ghosted me, which hurt like hell. i've learned in the year since that they thought i wa better than them because i wouldn't go out underage drinking with them, but if they had just \*asked\* i would've explained how i didn't trust myself not to binge drink, which i had had some issue with doing by myself on my darker days, but i digress. i picked up a different part time job while i wa going to college, and thankfully in each place made a few friend and rebuilt a social circle, including a wonderful fiance. still, i often wonder about my old friends, even though i shouldn't.anyhow, i got a low level manager job at a nursing home after i graduated from college. i didn't really like it, but i got a degree because my folk said i had to, and i took a job nearby so i could live with my fiance. so i'm working at this nursing home, and recognizing how terrible the healthcare industry is to elderly people. i also learned i hated managing people, and i hated that the place never closed. we paid so shitty that my staff would frequently just quit day of without notice, so i would always have to come in and pick up the slack. this led to me to work six and seven day a week even pre pandemic, so by late 2019 i wa already burning out hard. it didn't help that my regional manager also didn't like me, so i wa barely getting paid enough to make my end meet.then the pandemic came, and i thought i should stay put what with how many people around me were losing their job and facing uncertainty. i hated it, \*hated it\*, but a job is a job right?the pandemic, predictably, made every single problem with my job worse. i couldn't pin down employee to come to work, i couldn't keep up with my own work despite working two week at a go before a day off regularly. not to mention having to wear n95 mask with a traditional mask over top, sometimes with a face shield, sometimes with a full suit of ppe that wa often taped together.i would come home from work irritable, tired, and never had the time or energy to do anything. by late 2021, i had had enough. i wasn't eating well, sleeping enough, or doing good work. i put in my notice, and a few week later, moved on.it wa like something in my brain ha broken, and it still is. i feel consistently stressed, my brain is fogged over, and i just feel like overall i'm somehow functioning even worse than i wa even a year ago.to compound matters, i didn't realize how difficult it wa going to be to get another job. it turn out for a shitty a that job was, the security of it wa something i wouldn't be able to replace very easily. everyone said it wa a job searcher's market, but i can't find anything except for retail (which i don't want, i don't do well with people being mean to me a you might expect) and warehouse style work (which a chronic injury ha me unwilling to do). my option are limited, and it sucks. i've had a few short term gig jobs, but nothing that lead anywhere.it frustrates my parent because i don't think they believe i'm looking hard enough, meanwhile i'm applying to dozen of job each day. i will have phone interview and in person interviews, but for whatever reason i get skipped over every time. i don't know what i'm doing wrong, and each time i just want to die a little bit more. it feel like my degree isn't worth the paper it's printed on, and neither am i. i'm gonna have to suck it up and get back in a drive through i guess and swallow the ounce of pride that i had left in myself.all throughout this process i've been open with my fiance about my struggle mental physical or otherwise, but i can't in good conscience keep dumping my issue on her. she's a golden soul and i love her dearly, but i know she can't afford to just babysit me and my deteriorating mental health.and here's the part where everybody say ""if you need help, get help!"" or ""talk to a friend!"" or send those god awful ""reddit cares!"" messages, but a you might expect, money is tight. i'm donating plasma regularly to make end meet. i haven't been able to see so much a a dentist in the last year. i want to make an appointment when i finally get a job where i can have insurance, but i'm struggling to lock down any kind of job, let alone one with insurance, and my health is in freefall.i spend hour each day fantasizing about what it must be like to be neurotypical. i don't tell my friend much about how i struggle, but i suspect they know something is up because i'm spinning my wheels.these day i feel like i'm not staying alive for myself, i'm doing it because i can't bear the thought of leaving everyone else to pick up the pieces. mom and dad have had enough people close to them die in traumatic ways, my sister doesn't deserve this trauma, and i love my fiance so much. i already worry i'm putting too much on her, but if i go then i know she'll blame herself. for that matter, i don't want anyone to have to blame themselves about anything that happens to me. it all just feel like a cruel joke. stick around and be life's punching bag, or check out and leave that burden on my family and friends. they don't deserve that, they're all wonderful. i'm just so, so, so, tired. i feel like there's no way out for me.for the record: my family and my friend are all great people, regardless of what this may read like, so please don't say anything rude about them (when i proofread this i realized it doesn't paint a full picture of anyone described). mental health may be a blind spot for mom especially, but she is still my mom and i love her dearly.thanks for reading,

sharp headache in very specific part of my head and i read once that someone who had experienced that happened to be having an aneurysm. that caused me to have probably the worst anxiety attack in my life. i began having pain in other part of my body too around that time. i became a bit manic and wound up going to an urgent care doctor who had a ct scan machine. they checked my head out and said that i wa fine and they didn't find anything. at the time i wa following a ketogenic diet, with one meal a day fasting, and drinking a large cold brew coffee every morning. i didn't know that this wa bad for your stomach.  anyway the doctor asked me if i had taken advil for the headaches, i said yes i wa taking the recommended dosage every day, and he told me it would be fine to double that to alleviate the symptoms. so i did that. then not too long later after taking 1600 mg of advil (or something like that) on an empty stomach everyday with black coffee, i felt a painful swelling in my abdomen on my left side.this wa the first time i had ever felt this so i wa pretty panicked.  wa also feeling major fatigue, peripheral pain in my arm and legs, and overall just feeling terrible. i went to a different urgent care doctor after that and he said i had gastritis. the diet he recommended didn't really help, and from searching online i found what i wa feeling could leaky gut syndrome. there wasn't a lot of study behind it online but the diet that i found in article for that actually helped a lot. at least temporarily.over time i had experienced a bunch of weird symptom despite the gastritis being better, like muscle twitching, mild sore pain around my mid back and neck, heavy fatigue, and mild nausea. i didn't have insurance at the time so i wa just carrying on praying it would just stop and that i didn't have cancer or something.fast forward to april 2020, at this point i'm 25, and have gained a bit of weight. the health issue i were experiencing made it difficult to follow a low carb diet that always kept my weight down, and to stay motivated to work out. however, april 2020 gave me a lot of free time a it did everyone, and i started focusing on my stress and got back on a good diet. keto again but this time no advil.  for the month from april 2020 to august 2020, i wa feeling great. i lost around 30 pounds, and hadn't had any health issue ir weird symptom anymore. i fell off the diet after agust though, and then by october i gained a few pound back and then one day i woke up and felt very dizzy, and my heart kept beating weird. i also wa shirt of breath, and it felt like there wa something inside my lung preventing me from filling my lung completely. i just couldn't quite get full breath which wa very uncomfortable.i went to the er, and they did bloodwork, and chest xrays, and found nothing. i just kept living with it and working with this for the following month until jan 2021.finally i had health insurance again. i got a primary care physician, they send me to a cardiologist, i had a full work up, stress tests, ekg, and ultrasound or whatever the test is to look at the structure of your heart. they said i wa experiencing pvc's but they went away while i wa active during the stress test. they told me they didn't know why i wa having the pvcs, but probably weight gain (at this point i've gained 30 pound back, around 230 lbs, for a 5'8"" male. for the following month i start doing thing that i enjoy and trying to eat at least a little better, and exercise more, and the pvc never cane back. but there were still some issues...my lung capacity improved over time, but not entirely. i still get out of breath sometimes and i don't know why. granted i could be out of shape, but at 5'8"" and 230, i know thats over weight but i have family thats way larger and seem to function without these issues.the g.i. problem would keep coming and going, and i woukd have bout where i would wake up and be dizzy, and weak, and always seemed to happened when my stomach wasn't right. and i would also feel sharp pain inside of my chest that i wa worried wa cancer (another thing to note, i worry about cancer a lot because i work with pesticides, and grew up around cigarette smoke indoors, and vaped a lot through my early 20s).i saw my doctor about  this stuff but i've fallen into this cycle of seeing my doctor, my doctor prescribing med without diagnosing cause if the pain inside me, and then switching insurance at the end of the year, switching doctors, and having them do the same. none have ordered ct scans, or sent me to a g.i. specialist. american healthcare, particularly in ca suck right now.last fast forward to last friday, i had been doing alright and feeling alright for the past year. some pain popping up hear and there, and still out of breath but i try not to let it get to me. i always did have this looming ""when is the other show going to drop"" if the pain and breathlessness wa undiagnosed cancer or something. i also have a friend whose mother suddenly passed away from undiagnosed lung cancer that exacerbated these thoughts.  last friday i developed some back pain on my middle left. then throughtout the day it wa spreading to my stomach area on the left, and just gnawing at me. by friday night i wa feeling really fatigued, and weak, and nauseous again. saturday morning i woke uo in even more pain and weakness, but my girlfriend and i had ticket to la comic con, and i kept telling myself it wa just anxiety. i kept wondering all day, did i have pancreatitis? wa it pancreatic cancer this whole time? did it spread from my lungs? is it my kidneys? i tried to keep those thought out of my head, and i kinda felt better throughout the day but not completely.sunday/monday a bit better, tried to do some stretching, and went to the gym, tried to eat stomach healthy stuff, high and fiber and what not, and i wa okay but still not feeling well. today, tuesday, i woke up much earlier than normal and could not go back to sleep due to the gnawing on my left side, inside of me. i felt really sick and nauseous, peripheral pain in my arm and legs, constantly using the bathroom with not much happening, and the pain radiating around my back and feeling hot. i had to call out of work and wound up going to that same urgent care doctor from 4 year ago with the ct scan machine. unfortunately the machine wasn't working today, but besides that, i had bloodwork done, ultrasound of my kidneys, liver, pancreas, spleen, and a urinalysis. everything came back fine. they gave me a ""g.i. cocktail"" which wa a mixture of milanta, some other sruff and numbing agents. the doctor said that it would go through my system and numb my gastrointestinal track, and if i stopped feeling pain, they could confirm that it wa g.i. related at least. unfortunately the pain didn't stop at all. the pain to begin with wa moderate, and maybe a 6 or 7 out of 10, but still too difficult to function normally with. they spoke to my pcp, and i'm going to see a gastroenterologist soon, and i'm going back for the ct scan of my chest and abdomen next week when their machine work again, but anyway what i'm really here to ask is this:besides the gastrointestinal stuff, could all of the other pain really be from anxiety? ha any one else here really experienced this to that level? sharp recurring chest pains, deep fatigue, constant nausea, random nerve pain throughout my body, pain radiating around my back to my chest and left side? now that i'm home from the doctor, half of me is glad that they found nothing, but on the other hand i can't even lay down and relax comfortably because i just feel so sick and like my body is failing on me. half of me keep telling myself ""you're fine, it's anxiety, you know this, you've been through it before"" and the other half of me keep thinking ""this is the worst you've felt so far, it's probably more than anxiety, am i going to feel better? how am i going to make it through work tomorrow, the doctor found nothing and i have no excuse to call out, they haven't looked at my lung or stomach yet, i probably have cancer"".this
